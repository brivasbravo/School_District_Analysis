# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis

- Maria has contracted us to assist with some data analysis for the school district grades. There is evidence of
academic dishonesty among 9th graders in Thomas High School. Maria has requested to have those scores removed from
the analysis as to not skew the averages with tainted data. We will be using Pandas and Python in Jupyter Notebook
to help Maria with this task.

### How is the district summary affected?

1. Average Math score dropped by .1

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

This change severely affects relative performance because % passing math, reading, and overall are in the 60 showing a large portion are 
below passing at Thomas HS now.

### Math Scores by grade

Affect by grade is 9th graders math and reading changes to a 'nan' instead of a score:

### Scores by School spending

Scores by school spending was extremely minimal change. Formatted table would not show the
difference so the unformatted tables are used below to demonstrate the slightest change.
The average math score was lower by only .0017 and reading went up by .012 points. 
Math and reading passing % went down by .022 and .072 % and overall passing percent went down by .08%.
Changes all happened within $631-645 spending range row because Thomas HS is within this limit.

up by .1, % Passing Math is down by .017%, % Passing Reading down by .06%, and % Overall Passing is down by .07%.
